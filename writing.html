	<h1>WRITING</h1>
	<p>As of July 2017, I work as an associate editor at Digg. There, I launched Digg's series of <a href="http://www.digg.com/channel/fan-service">in-depth guides</a> to pop culture franchises. I've also written about <a href="http://digg.com/2018/disneyland-speedrun">real life speedrunning</a>, <a href="http://digg.com/2018/oscars-2018-best-picture-prediction-data-viz">data-driven Oscars speculation</a>, and <a href="http://digg.com/2017/portal-the-orange-box-ten-years-later-tf2-hl2">how weird it is to watch things you love turn cynical.</a></p>
	<p>I've written guides about <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-school-backpack-for-high-school-and-college/">backpacks</a> and <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-fidget-spinners/">fidget spinners (really)</a> for The Wirecutter.</p>
