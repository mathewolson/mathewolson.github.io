	<h1>WRITING</h1>
	<p>I'm a writer in the sense that I've been paid to write. I also happen to like writing, so it's a win-win.</p>
	<p><a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-school-backpack-for-high-school-and-college/">The Wirecutter</a> had me write a guide on backpacks for college and high school students. That's even me in the photos, being a totally natural backpack model.</p>
	<p>I signed on to contribute a few pieces to Digg's "How To Be An Adult" series in August of 2016. Here's <a href="http://digg.com/2016/how-to-treat-a-cut-finger-first-aid">some essential first aid advice</a>.</p>
	<p>In 2014, I wrote posts for Reed's alumni magazine about <a href="http://www.reed.edu/reed_magazine/sallyportal/posts/2014/data-sheds-light-on-alumni-giving.html">alumni giving</a> and a <a href="http://www.reed.edu/reed_magazine/sallyportal/posts/2014/stockroom-czar-goes-out-with-a-bang.html">beloved staff member</a>.</p>
