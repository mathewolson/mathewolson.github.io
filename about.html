	<h1>BIO</h1>
	<p>I'm a writer. I focus on topics in tech and entertainment, with some natural overlap in labor, politics and policy. As of July 2017, I work as an associate editor at Digg. </p>
	<p>I've co-hosted and edited three wildly different podcasts: <a href="https://twinpeakspeeks.simplecast.fm/">Twin Peaks Peeks</a>, Can You Get To That? and Finite Jest.</p>
	<p>I studied Economics at Reed College. While at Reed I also studied non-fiction writing, 20th century literature, environmental policy and statistics.</p>
	<p>I'm from Kirkland, WA (proud home of Costco).</p>
