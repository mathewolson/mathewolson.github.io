	<h1>BIO</h1>
	<p>I'm a writer focused on topics in tech, gaming, and entertainment. I'm launching a new AR/VR newslettter for The Information in March 2021. </p>
	<p>Previously, I worked as a reporter at USgamer.net. You can find links to all of that work—daily news posts, features, reviews, op-eds—by <a href="https://www.usgamer.net/authors/2004">clicking right here.</a> Before that, I was an associate editor at Digg, where I helped curate articles and videos for the front page while also working on original pieces for the site. I've also done freelance writing and research for Wirecutter.</p>
	<p>From 2015 to 2017, my friend Ashley and I worked on <a href="https://twinpeakspeeks.simplecast.fm/">a podcast about Twin Peaks.</a></p>
	<p>I studied Economics at Reed College. While at Reed I also studied non-fiction writing, 20th century literature, environmental policy, and statistics.</p>
	<p>I'm from Kirkland, WA (proud home of Costco).</p>
