	<h1>mathew olson - bio</h1>
	<p>I'm a Queens-based artist, writer, creative. I started my master's degree studies at the Interative Telcommunications Program (ITP) in 2022.</p>
	<p>My artistic output often takes the form of games or game-like projects. I enjoy taking things from the digital to the real, making work that can be touched and interacted with like arcade cabinets and bizarre input devices.</p>
	<p>I worked as a journalist for several years before starting at ITP, writing for publications including The Information, USgamer.net, and Digg. Links to some of that work can be found <a href="/writing">here</a>, though be warned that link rot has claimed a lot of those. Ain't the internet great?</p>
	<p>From 2015 to 2017, my friend Ashley and I worked on <a href="https://twinpeakspeeks.simplecast.fm/">a podcast about Twin Peaks.</a></p>
	<p>I majored in Economics at Reed College. While at Reed I also studied non-fiction writing, 20th century literature, environmental policy, and statistics.</p>
	<p>I'm from Kirkland, WA (proud home of Costco).</p>
