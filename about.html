	<p>Mathew Olson is a graduate of Reed College. He is the 2015 recipient of <a href="http://www.reed.edu/reed_magazine/sallyportal/posts/2015/econ-major-takes-meier-prize.html">the Gerald M. Meier Award for Distinction in Economics.</a> Some data visualization examples can be seen <a href="/data">here</a>, and questions about STATA, R, and qGIS are welcome.</p>
	<p>Mat's formal studies include economics, statistics, public policy, literature, environmental politics, familial histories, computing theory, and personal essay writing. Other pursuits outside of the classroom include screenprinting, calligraphy, event planning, and improvisational theatre.</p>
	<p>Mat has cultivated skills in digital, audio/video, and print production. He is the co-host of the podcasts <a href="https://canyougettothat.simplecast.fm">Can You Get To That?</a> and <a href="https://twinpeakspeeks.simplecast.fm">Twin Peaks Peeks</a>. He is also the creator of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDtKOWTQAY37aeHjWqBHoZQ">Go To Bed with Mat Olson</a>, a late night talk show. In 2014, Mat was an editor and the layout designer for that year's Reed Student Body Handbook. A digital sample of that work can be seen <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/miy74wauo4qhddn/reed_handbook_sample.pdf?dl=0">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Stemming from the handbook, Mat wrote posts for Reed's alumni magazine about <a href="http://www.reed.edu/reed_magazine/sallyportal/posts/2014/data-sheds-light-on-alumni-giving.html">alumni giving</a> and a <a href="http://www.reed.edu/reed_magazine/sallyportal/posts/2014/stockroom-czar-goes-out-with-a-bang.html">beloved staff member</a>.</a></p>
	<p>Mat knows that both his first and last name are easy to misspell. It just happens.</p>
