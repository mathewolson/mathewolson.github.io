	<h1>BIO</h1>
	<p>I'm a writer â€” my work has been published on Digg, The Wirecutter and on Reed Magazine's Sallyportal blog.</p>
	<p>I've co-hosted and edited three wildly different podcasts: Twin Peaks Peeks, Can You Get To That? and Finite Jest.</p>
	<p>I studied Economics at Reed College. Within my major I focused mainly on behavioral economics. While at Reed I also studied non-fiction writing, 20th century literature, environmental policy and statistics.</p>
	<p>I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest. I'm from Kirkland, WA (proud home of Costco).</p>
